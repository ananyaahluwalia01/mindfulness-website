Responsive Web Design Project

There are two parts to this assessment:

Part 1: Create a mobile/responsive website for your game. This must have multiple pages and appropriate navigation.

Part 2: Hosting your site on the real WWW - instructions for this coming later.

Part 1: Creating your website.

Minimum requirements:

Must have versions for each screen size
for laptop (>1024 pixels)
For tablets (768 - 1023 pixels)
For small tablets (560 - 767 pixels)
Smartphones (<560 pixels)
Must have more than 1 page
Must have navigation within each page (remember your work at the start of the year???)
Must have navigation between the pages

Notes:
The tutorial you’ve just done gives a good framework to work from
See if you can look back over the work at the beginning of the year and remember how you did some of the CSS transitions (similar to some of the images on this site)

What is the content of your site?

Well - you have lots of options here. It must be something to do with your game. Those of you who have a working game could look to build a web version of it and embed it on the site. Otherwise you can build it to advertise your game - have a “buy now” page with a special offer, for example. 

Have a look at one of your favourite game sites and see what they have on their websites for ideas.
