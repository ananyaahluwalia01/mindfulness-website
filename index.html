                    <p>Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to the internal experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation and other training. The term "mindfulness" is a translation of the Pali term sati, which is a significant element of some Buddhist traditions. The recent popularity of mindfulness in the West is generally considered to have been initiated by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Large population-based research studies have indicated that the practice of mindfulness is strongly correlated with greater well-being and perceived health. This is applicable to society at large as well as specific settings such as workplaces and schools. Studies have also shown that rumination and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of both rumination and worry.</p>

                    <p>In Buddhism, mindfulness has been advocated as a way to spiritual enlightenment and cessation of suffering. Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people who are experiencing a variety of psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions. Recent studies demonstrate that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates pain through multiple, unique mechanisms. It has gained worldwide popularity as a distinctive method to handle emotions. Clinical studies have documented both physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children. Programs based on Kabat-Zinn's and similar models have been widely adopted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans' centers, and other environments. </p>

                    <p>According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises. Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of clinical behavior analysis used in psychotherapy. It is a psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies to increase psychological flexibility. The approach was originally called comprehensive distancing. It was developed in the late 1980s by Steven C. Hayes, Kelly G. Wilson, and Kirk Strosahl. Keith Fiveson, MDiv, CARC, CCAR, founder of The Work Mindfulness Institute notes that MBRC helps people with behavioral or substance misuse to find relief from the stresses and triggers that have them "act out" - as a coping mechanism - and mindfulness is used to reduce relapse.</p>
